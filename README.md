As a fresher, I designed and developed an interactive Sales Analytics Dashboard in Power BI for a fictional company, Awesome Chocolates, to analyze key business metrics like sales, profit, and shipment performance.
I imported raw data into Power BI, transformed it using Power Query, and **built a Star Schema data model** with a Calendar table to enable time intelligence (MoM, YTD).
Created custom DAX measures for Total Sales, Profit %, MoM Growth, and Dynamic KPIs using functions like PREVIOUSMONTH and EDATE. 
Designed **KPI cards, a Profit % gauge, and a trend chart** using field parameters.
Added advanced visuals like a shipment histogram and performance tables for salespeople and products. 
Implemented **Bookmarks** for toggling views and designed a filter panel and **tooltips** to enhance user experience.
